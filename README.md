## About The Project

The goal of this project was to update my portfolio with the design system skills I've gained from prior projects. I aimed to minimize JavaScript dependency by adopting Astro as the web framework and concentrating on crafting a static site. Rather than opting for a headless content management system (CMS) such as Sanity, I opted to utilize Astro's Content Collections feature for a cohesive developer experience. This feature facilitated content management while ensuring automatic TypeScript type-safety.

### Highlights

- Project and blog cards arranged by date and ranking
- Detailed development process page for each project.
- Creation of dynamic routes during build time in Static Site Generation (SSG)
- üíØ Lighthouse score
- SEO per page using `astro-seo`
- Figma for wireframes and prototyping
